- Trading Simulation
Front-end: HTML/CSS/JavaScript and WebSocket for displaying trading charts, order books, and matched trades.
Back-end: Multithreaded trading matching engine written in C++ with Boost.Asio for asynchronous network communication.
Container Orchestration: Kubernetes for deploying and managing multiple client and server instances.
Project Highlights:

Multithreading: Utilized C++ standard library thread pool and condition variables for efficient order processing and matching.
Boost.Asio: Replaced traditional select and poll system calls with Boost.Asio library for high-performance asynchronous network communication.
Kubernetes: Deployed and managed the system with Kubernetes, simulating high concurrency and load balancing in a real trading environment.
Front-end Integration: Real-time display of trading data and order matching via WebSocket, providing an intuitive user experience.


- C++ Data Consolidation Platform
1. Engineered data submission modules in C++, implementing threading and queue mechanisms to handle large-scale data transfers efficiently. Employed XML for data serialization, supporting both full and incremental extraction methods.
2. Developed file transfer modules using FTP and custom TCP protocols, which involved threading for concurrent downloads/uploads and queue systems for managing transfer requests, ensuring high throughput and reliable data synchronization.
3. Integrated event-driven architecture within server-side components to optimize performance and scalability, particularly for data processing workflows and synchronization tasks in a distributed database environment using Oracle RAC and standalone instances.
